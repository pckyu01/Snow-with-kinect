<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: [[Snow with Kinect]]</h1>

<strong>Interaction</strong>:People can play with their hands. They will be able to stack up the snows as whatever they want.

<strong>Description</strong>: There will be snowflaks falling from the top of the screem. When it touches our hands(using Kinect), it is going to react like a real snow. It is not going to melt, but we can push it or grap it. When snowflakes get closer and their distance becomes less than a certain distance, it will be stick together and not fall apart. So people can stack them up.

  <h3>Milestone #1: November 20th, 2015 </h3>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> You should have solid planning done by the end of this milestone.
  <ul>
    <li>first task : I have to write basic code without using kinect first.</li>
    <li>second task : I tried to learn and apply some ArrayList for snowflakes.</li>
    <li>third task : I applied vectors for snowflaks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Milestone #2: November 30th, 2015 </h3>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> You should have a small prototype by the end of this milestone.
  <ul>
    <li>first task : I tried to make my program work with my mouse before using kinect</li>
    <li>second task : I had to fix some bugs on snowflakes like disappear/stuck.</li>
    <li>third task : I made my program to adjust number snowflakes itself to make less lag.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Milestone #3: December 7th, 2015 (For C block)</br>
  Milestone #3: December 8th, 2015 (For G block) </h3>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> You should have iterated and improved on your prototype by the end of this milestone.
  <ul>
    <li>first task : I connected kinect to my program.</li>
    <li>second task : Discovered how to apply kinect to my project and make it work.</li>
    <li>third task : Presentation.</li>
  </ul>
