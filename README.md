<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: [[Snow]]</h1>

<strong>Interaction</strong>:People can play with their hands. They will be able to stack up the snows as whatever they want.

<strong>Description</strong>: There will be snowflaks falling from the top of the screem. When it touches our hands(using Kinect), it is going to react like a real snow. It is not going to melt, but we can push it or grap it. When snowflakes get closer and their distance becomes less than a certain distance, it will be stick together and not fall apart. So people can stack them up.
